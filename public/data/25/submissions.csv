This scene is the first time young Wick goes to battle. At first, he is nervous, and awkward. A hardcore jungle beat plays in the background. He is gifted, but unsure. Then a bullet whizzes by his ear, and at the same time, the largest man in the room backhands him in the temple. It stings, but he almost chuckles.

We hear his heartbeat slow down. He is awake now. This song kicks in, as Wick kicks heads. When all is said and done, there are too many corpses to count. But they were all worthy kills. Wick is fascinated by this new life of his. The sun sets, and we fade to black as the song fades out ",0a9dac759c584cc4810c6697db05d118,Yes

Well, the drummer from My Bloody Valentine time-travelled two decades into the future to sample it and add it to this 1991 song that he wrote and produced for this otherwise perfect album. 

(To paraphrase a classic HT headline from our very own James Knapp, we can assume that the rest of the band let him do this on the understanding that it counted as both his birthday and Christmas presents). 

It's short, but not throwaway - real dedication has gone into crafting this awful blend of dying tauntaun, timpani and synthetic-yet-somehow-slightly-sharp strings, which, terrifyingly, he described as ""the story of a sexual encounter"".

It's kind of the perfect La Dispute song imo.

I also considered the new Format release, which is of similarly questionable hidden-ness. That or something from Friends in Real Life, but as much as I tear up thinking about Pat being back making music, I'm still not 100% sure how much I like most of those songs.

Anyway this is just such a fantastic song for when you love your family so goddamn much but life is still complicated and hard and fucked up",5eaa0409ea0448238f7b814cba6057be,Yes
