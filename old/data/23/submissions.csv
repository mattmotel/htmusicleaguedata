Raised on squash and seeds

The ""sexiest"" things about this song have nothing to do with overtly sexual, or horny things. There's nothing sexier than being yourself, and being confident about who you are, and Chrissie has that in spades.

This song and the whole album it‚Äôs on is based on a passage of an obscure 1876 book by A. J. Pleasonton called The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky which was an early precursor to the pseudoscientific practice of color therapy. 

From the wiki:

‚ÄòThe image on the album cover was constructed with a list of twenty-five themes (for example ""Unfounded or Wildly Broad Claims"", ""Wonderment"", and ""Light/Optics/Color""), each representing a specific color, assigned to each sentence in both the passage and the lyrics. If more than one theme is assigned to the same sentence, the colors are combined with additive mixing. With each sentence being represented by a colored line, the lines are arranged radially giving the impression of beams of multicolored light emanating from the center.‚Äô

But I‚Äôm also a huge sucker for moons and moon symbolism. I don‚Äôt know why. But this silhouetted person sitting on this rock framed by a giant looming moon really speaks to me.

Members were encouraged to play instruments they hadn‚Äôt mastered so they‚Äôd be less inhibited. It was also to just record and have fun and not worry about any commercial hit or anything. Claypool tried to release the album through Mammoth Records who not only rejected it, but also dropped Claypool‚Äôs own Prawn Song label from their label. Decades later, the songs were released through Sean Lennon‚Äôs label and they saw the light. It‚Äôs a really weird but charming album. This is perhaps the most mainstream song on here.
