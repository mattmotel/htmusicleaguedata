It’s an undeniably upbeat love story about a man who is truly trying his hardest to please a woman (hostage) who doesn’t appreciate his work, and whether he should murder her. Also there are wolves. ",3b9df9a428f646bb8950663a4027957f,Yes

The ultimate outsider artist

Scroll through this man’s discography. It looks like he self-released an album every week in 2023. 

Not sure if he is mentally ill, on drugs or both, but I admire his prolificness. 

The lyrics may be crass and gratuitous,  but he seems so damn earnest so it almost feels wholesome, and the song has a positive message. ",ff9c8f7941c54ed0bc60ef87cfcc5031,Yes

I loved this particular band. Really good pop rock sensibilities. They’re no longer together. Miss those old days. As a bonus, check out Woodhands. I was torn between the two.

I managed to get them into the Hard Times ""Six Songs We Listened To this Week...."" column a couple of months ago, with the effect that that they gained a bunch of listeners and became ineligible for last season's ""You probably haven't heard of them"" round 10. Hoisted by my own petard!
