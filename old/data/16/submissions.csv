Persona: I'd come out dressed as an old wizard. I'd walk slowly with a cane then as I get to the ring the ref lifts my cloak to reveal... An even older, more frail wizard. The shock value would make my opponent faint immediately.

Finishing move: With my opponent already on the ground I would pull a Fairlight CMI from my tattered wizard hat and rip that bitchin' sampled orchestra hit solo while giving a slow wink to the camera as it zooms in. ",53fa87d179cb46c7b4d512e93f0efea9,Yes

Persona: A charismatic showman. This cunning underdog is always willing to bend the rules to win, with a flair for dramatic comebacks and a loyal fanbase.

Signature Move: The Boston Bribe - The King distracts opponents with a fake bribe, then swiftly ensnares them in a decisive lock, leaving one arm free to kiss babies.

The video isn’t anything huge in concept or flashy; I just think it perfectly fits the vibe of the band and the song.
