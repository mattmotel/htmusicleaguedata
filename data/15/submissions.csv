Shit, what about an anthem?

EASYFUN: I got you SC, listen to THIS -

SC: Fuck me that's harsh. Got any Sousa?

EF: I can Sousify it, easy. Listen from 0.52 and imagine some stirring brass and a choir. Plus the lyrics are all about Finland taking us for granted.

SC: Whooo! Lap-land! Lap-land! Lap-land!",e350ea6734534cf0bb6e40a4032708a2,Yes
