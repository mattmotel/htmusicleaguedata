Okay now that you all are familiar with the Hatman song I think we need to close the loop and talk about the music video. 

Lou Bega must have just seen an iPhone commercial for the first time and decided to stretch one out for 4 minutes. He pads the time out with stock footage of people dancing and shots of him trying on dozens of cool new hats. All the while the ghost of Scatman John wanders in and out of the shots.
