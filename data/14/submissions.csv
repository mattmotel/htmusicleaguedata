Hey champ,

I know you're into all that drone metal stuff. And well, I tried, but I just don't understand it, and I'm scared of getting you something you'll hate. So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to take you to the store and you can pick out a song you really want this year. But I wanted you to have something under the tree, so I got you this. I know it's not the same stuff, but it features heavy use of repetition and there's a bit of fun distortion at the end.

It's the most wholesome sport, and using a bunch of curling terms as a metaphor for a relationship is the kind of dorky that this round needs.
