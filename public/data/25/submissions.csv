This scene is the first time young Wick goes to battle. At first, he is nervous, and awkward. A hardcore jungle beat plays in the background. He is gifted, but unsure. Then a bullet whizzes by his ear, and at the same time, the largest man in the room backhands him in the temple. It stings, but he almost chuckles.

We hear his heartbeat slow down. He is awake now. This song kicks in, as Wick kicks heads. When all is said and done, there are too many corpses to count. But they were all worthy kills. Wick is fascinated by this new life of his. The sun sets, and we fade to black as the song fades out ",0a9dac759c584cc4810c6697db05d118,Yes

Well, the drummer from My Bloody Valentine time-travelled two decades into the future to sample it and add it to this 1991 song that he wrote and produced for this otherwise perfect album. 

(To paraphrase a classic HT headline from our very own James Knapp, we can assume that the rest of the band let him do this on the understanding that it counted as both his birthday and Christmas presents). 

It's short, but not throwaway - real dedication has gone into crafting this awful blend of dying tauntaun, timpani and synthetic-yet-somehow-slightly-sharp strings, which, terrifyingly, he described as ""the story of a sexual encounter"".

I love songs where the vocals harmonize with the chords throughout, and this song does it better than most. It's such a gorgeous melody.

Conrad Keely started this as a poem about being a small fish in a big pond, and his vocals on the last verse are the stuff that musical magic is made of.

Finally, by the mid-90s Hawaii caught up in a big way.

In the early 90s, a bunch of punks and old hippies started this borderline pirate station called Radio Free Hawaii, and soon after, it made waves on terrestrial radio. They literally played everything, but most of it wasn't Top 40. Not only did we have arguably the best station in the world, but it inspired the coolest weirdos to join bands.

The Tantra Monsters were seemingly an instant smash. Their live shows were legendary. Their vocalist was a true one of a kind character. Mike Park soon signed them to Dill Records. (He still names this as one of his top 5 albums ever)

And then, the Hawaii Conundrum: The mainland wanted them. They'd done everything here. The problem-Hawaii was home, and not everyone wanted to move. This is common, but they were the best and biggest to break up before they broke big.",c253fe580ec1497aa45b29a0afb5b985,Yes
