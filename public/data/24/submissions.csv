There are definitely some amazing songs from that period, but when they reformed after 22 years apart they sounded calmer, more confident (now that they were finally getting their dues as scene legends), and more mature, plus the production was massively improved compared to the rather insipid production of the 90s albums. 

This track in particular is wonderful, and listening to the two exes duet on a song that reflects on time and relationships, many years on from the end of theirs, is very affecting (and makes me bawl pretty much every time that I listen to it). ",f39eaddadb394685b683f303188d1b43,Yes

So when Rick Rubin found the disheveled old rebel hero, I think Johnny felt humbled, inspired, and maybe even a little scared, but I think he wanted to rebel one last time, and what better way than to cover a bunch of weird songs, and record them alongside some new takes on old standards. Moody songs. Darker songs. Songs outside of his comfort zone. Obscure songs like this Beck track from Stereopathetic Soul Manure.

It was refreshing. It felt like finding a new artist. And while the grips of death were slowly trying to drag him down, I don't think Johnny ever felt more free artistically.

The year is 1995. An upstart rock outfit heavily influenced by REM and grunge, starts picking up steam. This culminates with For Squirrels signing a major label deal with Sony. In October, the album comes out, and by January of 2006, this thoughtful tribute to Kurt Cobain, is getting decent airplay on college radio, eventually reaching #15 on the modern rock charts.

I immediately loved this when they aired it on 120 Minutes, and was immediately bummed to discover that the lead singer, and bassist were killed in a tour van accident back in September of 2005, a month BEFORE the album dropped.

The other members played on, but it was ultimately impossible to overcome half their soul being removed on the brink of their introduction to the world.",d16fa0d67d1142108ed5116a1c7d430f,Yes

During the famed ‘Paul is Dead’ conspiracy, some even speculated he was brought in to record ‘Paul’s’ vocal parts. 

Unfortunately, Rhodes’ signed a bad deal. His contract with Dunhill Records demanded an album once every six months, an obligation Rhodes was unable to fulfill due to his time consuming DIY recording style.

Rather than work with Rhodes’ schedule, Dunhill decided to sue him for $250,000 citing a breach of contract. The trial effectively killed his career. Silent for 43 years, Rhodes released his fourth and final proper solo record in 2016 before passing in 2020.

System Blower by Death Grips seems like something scared old white dudes would immediately turn off before they even knew what offended them. 

I opted for this gem, because it's underrated in its mad simplicity, and it sounds just unhinged enough to raise red flags, and lots of hilarious questions, probably. (""Man, this guy is REALLY into Scorsese, huh?""; ""What do you think it sounds like when he hates someone?"")

I believe I first heard this magical man rapping on a song with two other extraordinary, and highly underrated MCs, K-the-I??? and Sole, and soon thereafter started digging around for other stuff.

When I first heard this track, I was immediately drawn to it. The beat was super interesting, and his lyrics were great, and boastful but kind of comically, feeling tongue-in-cheek, due to the fact that he's talking shit about dumb things that other rappers tend to do. He also says the word ""fuck"" many times in the song, but makes fun of the fact that he's doing so, ala Ben Folds.

This is just quintessential, super ill, ignored by the mainstream hip hop, that I pray one day gets played on radios somewhere, because there are countless tracks like this, begging to inspire current and future weirdos who need other weirdos to listen to. ",896ad5a5c7364b63bb163434100919f7,Yes
