8829ae3cdd2a49e09c3c5feadfb22ae0,2023-10-08T16:09:27Z,A legit spooky playlist,"Let's make a legit spooky playlist. Not the kind you've heard a million times before. Let's put our combined year of music league experience to good use. Stick to the spirit ðŸ‘»

Here are the rules:
- No novelty songs (no Monster Mash)
- No songs written for horror soundtracks (no Shining theme)
- No spooky-by-association songs â€“ Songs that arenâ€™t scary but are used in a scary movie so have become 'spooky' (i.e. Tiny Tim)
- No obvious songs (No Danzig-related, no songs called Halloween)",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ss5UcFo4cWeamZJ8L71PZ
9c9fdf0d116c4070abe455bb2c2e23bd,2023-10-11T23:11:47Z,A song you've never heard before,"Honor system!

Submit a song you've never heard before and tell us in the comments how you picked. Maybe a band you've heard of but never listened to? Or heard one song but that's it? Or totally at random?

Here's the catch: it still has to be a banger. Only bangers get votes.",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ifHaeI1tWyZUx4nyF1FtK

c9adcf421c524346ac6df28d28e654d4,2023-10-19T19:53:26Z,Why donâ€™t people talk about this band more? Because I think theyâ€™re legendary,"You have voted. You all want a nice playlist full of good songs. So submit a band you think is legendary but overlooked that we'll all like.

And no bullshit like ""my chem doesn't get enough credit"", ""the Beatles are STILL underrated"" or something. 

And Sam's rule: no obvious choices.",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4QDcGZejbRS7LtKfOnT8tg
d4bd32582aa34c39bd736ca68c98f469,2023-10-22T16:33:35Z,Songs that could feature a skeleton that plays itself like a xylophone,"You asked for it: spooky round 2.

This round presumes that a skeleton playing itself as a xylophone is a mostly playful act (still spooky, however) and not some horrific form of skeleton self-flagellation.

Nick Cave is banned. Monster Mash is banned. Pop punk isn't banned but you saw how it did last round so maybe learn from it.",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5qt67isubNc39P3pe1vBT3

voting rule - if you've heard the band before then you can't give it any votes. If you've only heard OF the band... you can vote.",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2sDJthq4tVp7lWDkFsGrWb
