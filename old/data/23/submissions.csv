Theme: A nostalgic ode to the fleeting youth of an adventurous squirrel.

'Well she was an American squirrel
Raised on squash and seeds
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a little more to life, somewhere else
After all she was a great big squirrel

Theme: The terrible aesthetic of the 2003 internet — back when the web was just visually ugly, not ugly deep in its soul. And of course, it fits the general aesthetic/vibe of the original song.

The ""sexiest"" things about this song have nothing to do with overtly sexual, or horny things. There's nothing sexier than being yourself, and being confident about who you are, and Chrissie has that in spades.

I would prefer a smidge more vulnerability (another sexy trait I really  love), but I can't deny the overall vibe she brings naturally. She knows we all want to fuck her. She doesn't need to shove it down our throats, be gross, or make it awkward.",e1a3b852065d4888b199136e2f38f051,Yes

This song and the whole album it’s on is based on a passage of an obscure 1876 book by A. J. Pleasonton called The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky which was an early precursor to the pseudoscientific practice of color therapy. 

From the wiki:

‘The image on the album cover was constructed with a list of twenty-five themes (for example ""Unfounded or Wildly Broad Claims"", ""Wonderment"", and ""Light/Optics/Color""), each representing a specific color, assigned to each sentence in both the passage and the lyrics. If more than one theme is assigned to the same sentence, the colors are combined with additive mixing. With each sentence being represented by a colored line, the lines are arranged radially giving the impression of beams of multicolored light emanating from the center.’

For me, this album is better than most Floyd albums. It’s very dreamy and kinda lulls you into this sense of serenity. The title track is a fave. But I’m also a huge sucker for moons and moon symbolism. I don’t know why. But this silhouetted person sitting on this rock framed by a giant looming moon really speaks to me. Would be cooler if it was the moon from Majora’s Mask. Or the moon from Mac Tonight. Well, actually it wouldn’t, this moon works. But man, what a great word moon is.

Members were encouraged to play instruments they hadn’t mastered so they’d be less inhibited. It was also to just record and have fun and not worry about any commercial hit or anything. Claypool tried to release the album through Mammoth Records who not only rejected it, but also dropped Claypool’s own Prawn Song label from their label. Decades later, the songs were released through Sean Lennon’s label and they saw the light. It’s a really weird but charming album. This is perhaps the most mainstream song on here.
