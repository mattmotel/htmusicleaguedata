She seems to have had figured out what mattered to her and what didn’t by then. The unpolished sound, the expression on her face, and the straightforward title of the album “Sings the Truth” all feel refreshing to me. 

I recommend checking her other (less catchy) stuff out. She was always on the right side of history. ",27980503e35542acb7976a64eaeacdc6,Yes

But you have to have an open mind, and have the right people around you. And so I go back to the early 90s, the most formative years for me, musically. 

The station I'm listening to plays literally everything. Tons of punk and ska. A fair share of metal. Lots of reggae. Some grunge, and classic rock sprinkled in. Surprisingly dope hip hop, and every few hours, a curve ball. I wasn't looking for that pitch, but I needed to experience it. 

I hadn't heard her classics yet. I didn't know her history. But I had never heard a voice like that, and it knocked me over. I didn't know she had stacks of undeniable bangers, but was often ignored by the powers that be. But I could hear it in her voice.

I didn't realize this was her at the age of 50, at a crossroads. She recorded this in 1988. A new age was right around the corner. I didn't know she was gone for years, waiting for the industry to throw her a bone again. But I heard it all in her voice.",27980503e35542acb7976a64eaeacdc6,Yes

Local rancher Dan The Horse Man is struggling to pay the mortgage on his family’s famed riding hall, Horsey Hostel, eventually forcing into auction where it is purchased by the notorious tycoon Ace Moneybags Jenkins. Dan is devastated and pleads with Jenkins to allow him to keep his prized mare and companion Nettie. This request is ultimately refused setting the stage for the 157th greatest revenge story ever told.

I’ll let you fill in the blanks as I’m running out of space, but there are guns, dynamite, and classic one liners like ‘I AM DAN. THE HORSE MAN. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MY HORSE.’

In the film’s climax, Dan concocts a brilliant plan to convince all of the horses at the ranch to stampede and trample Ace, but ultimately abandons the idea in favor of just shooting him and burning down the ranch after letting the horses free.

In the first 37 seconds of the song we've seen the horses walk slowly towards the edge of shot. Following this, the last horse in the pack senses something, slows, turns and trots across the shallow water.

The horse reaches the other side of the water and starts nuzzling at an unconscious figure lying half on the ground and half in the water. The figure comes to. She's a woman in her sixties, wearing a wedding dress that dates from 19th century. But as she gets up she seems to have no idea why she'd be wearing it. 

The horse kneels as if inviting the woman to get on. She does, and the horse rises and starts walking. The woman spurs the horse into a canter, but seems confused at so how she did so and how she is able to stay balanced.

She feels something in the collar of her dress, and reaches out a scrap of folded-up yellowing paper. She opens it. There's just one line of handwritten inked text, reading: ""This is the fifth time"".",98220b53c0bb4b97b11fe5d00b24ff71,Yes
